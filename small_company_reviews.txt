However, with the substantial cut in Square's valuation, many employees have stock option grants that are entirely in the red.

Unfortunately, like many companies that start small and focused, they lack the managerial focus to become a standout performer.As my title suggests, the story of Square boils down to this: it's a case study in misdirected talent.And talent there is: Square boasts some great industry minds (as some of the more benevolent reviews suggest.) However, it is my view and my personal experience that winning product strategies, focused execution, and experienced management can succeed with merely \"good\" talent, while no amount of talent can rescue a company devoid of the other elements. Do they really fall down in those areas? Let's examine each notion in turn:* Product Strategies: an Uphill Battle *Virtually all of Square's low-or-no-margin payment businesses (mobile Reader,Square Register, Cash, etc.) face enormous competition from both entrenched competitors and more focused upstarts. Although it is the opinion of the author that the Reader product is the best in the business, the ugly truth may be (much to the dismay of their meticulous designers) that margins matter more to customers than design, and in this area, they will be driven to the dirt by Amazon and others.* Inefficient Execution *It's hard to quantify execution capability. From the perspective of the author, however, I would say that I have seen much more accomplished, by fewer (less talented) people, in less time. The reason this is true is that the rank-and-file engineer at Square has little industry experience, and many managers have no prior experience managing people. (This is discussed below.)* Poor Management *Past Glassdoor reviews (some of which seem to have disappeared) mentioned chaotic, Twitter-like management, replete with disorienting reorganizations. This is still the case. While there is significant talent at the senior level, the middle management is rife with inexperienced young people who have never managed others at all, many of whom were promoted due to their perceived engineering ability.This has led to several situations that would be hilarious if they weren't so sad: Lack of clear ownership of major functionality, huge variability of code quality across teams, borderline-hostile code reviews, poor training, humiliating and unprofessional behavior in meetings, bad technology choices, and so on.ConclusionDespite the hype, talent, and early success of the Reader product, and despite the purported sky-high valuation (which makes no sense when compared to industry comps), Square is no longer a horse worth betting on. With a product portfolio consisting of low or no margin businesses, its apparent lack of focus and efficiency, and terrible management all add up to a company whose drawbacks far exceed potential benefits.Recent college graduates should realize that the company is no longer a start-up; you're joining a medium sized firm that's still struggling to find its way in a sea of competitors. If you're talented enough, you'd be better off trying for Google or another quality big firm to shore up your skills, and THEN move to a start-up.The situation is even worse for experienced hires: compensation won't match what a skilled engineer can earn elsewhere, with far less hassle, and more prospects for growth. You're also likely to face a bait-and-switch when it comes to your position and duties, as well as the aforementioned issues with bad management.At the end of the day, while probably not a sinking ship, Square is idling at port, bobbling listlessly while the smartest rats scurry down the mooring lines for the relative safety of the rotting boards of the dock.", "date": "2014-12-14"}, "empReview_5475291": {"rating": "4.0", "pros": "Unlimited time off, great perks and benefits, amazing people, and fun quirky culture", "cons": "Things can be very chaotic, the leadership isn't too mature, people seem to not like their work, not very many options for promotion", "date": "2014-12-03"}, "empReview_5272479": {"rating": "5.0", "pros": "Square has been a great place to work for the past few years.

Any of these cons could be gone in a month or two, or replaced with new ones. There's just no way to know!That said:- Immature leadership has been an ongoing theme for my entire tenure. It's been a problem at every level of leadership from executive on down at some point or another. On the other hand - I think this is to be expected of a company this age and size, and is usually course-corrected eventually.- Immature HR (incl. compensation adjustment and talent review). First iterations of talent review were downright insulting: we were rated by shape (circle, square, or star) like kindergardeners. Luckily we acknowledged that was a horrible idea and have never done it again - but our cadence of performance feedback has remained random at best. Same goes for cadence of compensation adjustment. If you get a job here - NEGOTIATE UP FRONT - there's no telling how many months or years it might be until someone thinks to themselves \"oh maybe we should look at comp again!\". Note: this situation has already improved immensely with the introduction of a consistent engineering ranking/ladder system - if we manage to keep it more than a year, that is.- Rampant politics and personal agendas. To be expected at any growing company. We have them too. Nothing special to see here, move along.- Oncall policies. No overtime pay for brutalizing oncall shifts are the norm. No compensation for personal phone use either. Occasionally you'll get a \"thank you\" from someone.- Not enough bathrooms. Not kidding. Try and find a free stall or urinal sometime after lunch.

Full time roles are advertised as available but I know for a fact there was never headcount to begin with. All this makes the company seem disingenuous as they are constantly trying to convince people that they're the \"good guys\" in merchant services.Business health: Cost cutting is apparent throughout the organization (not that this is a bad management style, but it seems to be a signal something more). Sometimes it feels like some people are shoving the proverbial company \"kool-aid\" down people's throats; I think anyone with a discerning eye knows what's going on.Working environment: The company is large now so there is a lot of red tape and channel conflict. Be prepared to manoeuvre a highly political environment. Your experience largely depends on your team and manager (like every other corporate) and culture is obviously much less cohesive than at smaller companies. Tricky thing is even if you get onto a great team, I guarantee that team will not stay that way long.Churn is very high at this company (for many reasons) so don't count on anyone sticking around for very long. 4 months in and you're considered a veteran!

Don't expect to have much privacy about your life here, you wanting to keep anything private is considered holding you back from your own development. Vacation time or days off are difficult and I found that the only way to have control over my life balance was to have a group of employees that had each other's backs and would barter coverage when needed (I got you if you get me this day). Compensation is hourly with enhancement of team commission for most positions, how well you do depends mostly on the success of the store location and organization of management. At times you will be pressured into incorporating many workouts at many locations all over your city and that at times can be very stressful and tiring.

There's no accountability in terms of what the key leaders or assistant managers might be doing that you have a problem with (very \"who watches the watchmen\" sort of deal). Like many have said here, most - if not all - of your managers are in their mid-20s and it shows. They tout work-life balance as something that they strive for, but honestly, if you're not showing your face and making your presence known/chumming it with upper management, you will be cast aside. Many people felt that hours were given based on preferential treatment, and not on actual needs as displayed by the employees. Compensation, though higher than the average rate, was still very little, and with such volatility in how many hours you might be receiving, it was often stressful not knowing how much income you might actually be receiving. Furthermore, they expected you to often come much earlier than your shift, which is understandable; however, receiving negative \"feedback\" for arriving not early enough by their standards was difficult to comprehend, especially when many people could not sustain a living simply by working at Lululemon, and required other forms of employment to maintain an adequate standard of living.Power plays were definitely a thing here, and that might come from the fact that management was just a couple years older than the average educator. This became especially apparent when after working under various managers; because no one was in charge of the managers, often working under one of their shifts meant that you would do things their way, which often undermined the work of another manager. But it didn't matter, because there was no one there to hold them accountable for their actions. Innovation, like the work-life balance, was constantly encouraged, so long as you didn't annoy anyone in management. Finally, as many other have said here, management constantly doled out what they termed \"feedback\", which more often than not felt like a way for them to undermine your work and/or paint you as a bad employee. If there was something that they didn't particularly like that you did, they would make sure to make a note of it so that other managers could see your \"shortcomings\". In the end, there was not much wiggle room for the creativity that they talked about so freely; it was often best to put your head down, make few suggestions, and do the task at hand (or, if the store was empty and there was nothing to do, pretend that you were doing something).This is all unfortunate, because although I did enjoy my time there as a whole, it became very apparent that unless I wasn't completely willing to bow down to the culture and drink the Lulu Kool-Aid, then I would forever be considered an outsider.", "date": "2014-05-06"}, "empReview_4168974": {"rating": "2.0", "pros": "They pay for you to workout and you meet a ton of people.

This company, that I have loved and been a committed employee for nearly 2 decades, has become a watered-down, culture-depleted version of what it once was. This behaviour has been excused and explained away, as a desire to be in a place of constant innovation and lauded as a means to make store teams more accountable to Guest Experience and sales goals. Recent changes to employee sales commissions have been touted as a means to grow our businesses in the spirit of entrepreneurship. The reality is employees are feeling the fall-out of over-worked, poorly supported, and under-paid management teams, a decline in sales commission YOY, and fewer hours. Employees are being asked to give so much, in return for much less than they have ever received. There is little corporate-historical memory for what made this company \"cool\" and what made it possibe to recruit and retain amazing people. There is less support at the regional level for store teams, and less hours for store management teams to truly connect with and develop their people. Labour optimization strategies , scheduling tools and company policies have inhibited store managers from supporting their teams with consistent hours, consistent pay and consistent opportunities for personal development.

There is a culture that individuals do not have the freedom to make decisions without getting the okay from management in some way.Over the past few months with the acquisition of Adaptive Insights there has been a major shift of the priorities of management from caring about their employees and putting them first. It is now a priority of meeting deadlines and making the company a quick dollar instead. There used to be a set of meetings set aside to discuss issues in a round table setting that have now been cancelled indefinitely, this gives the perception that employees and culture are no longer importantIn the past there would be weekly/monthly 1 on 1's with managers and their employees and now those don't ever happen unless the employee insists on meeting with their manager to discuss issues. Even then it is clear the manager is bothered they have to take time away from their day to meet even for 15 minutes.Many hiring decisions are being made before a position is even open and then the position will be filled by a new outside person with the first couple days of a position being opened, not giving any opportunity to an internal employee first.Promotions are always said to be given not just because you checked off a few boxes but because there needs to be a \"need\" first and there needs to be an opportunity for it.

DO NOT tell management anything regarding your future plans.Some workers on certain teams are incompetent and lazy. Will take long vacations and knowing that their vacation date is coming up, will delay their work and not finish because they know someone else will pick up their slack. Some will always wait until the end of sprints to log bugs or start work so that they can pretend that they were super busy the whole sprint; therefore, the need to roll over stories.People are being hired just because they are related to someone who already works here or is someone's friend. For example, the qualification for a QA Engineer job here is at least 5 years minimum in QA. In the QA industry, if you have actually been working for 5 years, you would know what TDD or BDD or other commonly used QA terms mean. I have seen QAs in meetings ask what TDD or BDD mean and have asked for explanations. This tells me that they probably got the job through a family/friend and/or faked their resume to get the job.Annual raises is based on how much you suck up to management, and how much they like you. Even if you do all your work and take everything they dump on you, if management doesn't like you, your raises won't be as high as someone who did less work but is a friend of management.People using all sorts of excuses on a regular basis to work from home or not come in to work.

A rise from the PeopleSoft ashes after big bad Oracle came and ruined their party. The values Dave and Aneel brought and put into Workday at the beginning are great.

While this is often true at any organization, the risks are greater at Workday, as their leadership has done a poor job to hold managers accountable and keep that culture together. This is especially true in the Support organization where micro management reigns.Leaders and managers are not held accountable. HR has done their best to facilitate feedback sessions within organizations. The ending results end up being nothing, as the leaders who receive poor feedback either push back or never change, and even worse, are not required to by their own leaders.The leaders of customer support are notorious for extreme micro management. It\u2019s common practice to see the VPs and Directors actively commenting on support cases and internal incidents, often when the case or incident is already under control and being processed successfully by an analyst. When their own people have pushed back to complain that this limits their growth and autonomy, they have been ignored or no action has been taken to try to correct, it\u2019s just the way it is.There is an extreme lack of accountability and collective team attitude built into Workday\u2019s culture. When things are running smooth, everyone is happy. Hope and pray you aren\u2019t the one who makes a mistake, because the mindset across orgs is the blame game. I was shocked to see common attitudes of \u201cThis is X\u2019s fault\u201d in this org rather than \u201cHow do we work through this together and prevent it in the future\u201d. This is a cultural problem that stems down from the top.Career growth and progression are not clear. Culturally the mindset has been to put the manager in charge of facilitating growth and feedback within their own people. This is great when the manager is comfortable having career discussions with their people and meets with them frequently. Given Workday has struggled to coach and train their managers to be successful at this, many managers do a poor job, leaving employees confused on where they stand, and what their future options are, both at Workday and within their existing organization.", "date": "2017-09-27"}, "empReview_16697801": {"rating": "3.0", "pros": "Great product ,great teams, Great company,on site snacks,bring your pet to work,investment in millenials", "cons": "Haphazard interview process -not standardized,it depends on hiring managersSalt lake city office is a cultural misnomer ie Zero diversity in engagement and a few diverse employee faces (per EEO).Solutions sold to customers do not reach other departments, resulting in inefficiencies and over-staffingOccasional pet at work blues such as barking dog", "date": "2017-09-06"}, "empReview_16222345": {"rating": "3.0", "pros": "Groups that focus on wellness, sustainability, and charitable causes.

Even though I liked my team I felt like I did not have the resources to be successful.This all sounds like a con but its not...because s**t happens and at some companies nothing would ever change and eventually you would just give up and find a better job.HOWEVER, at Workday I have seen coordinated effort from management (mid-level) from Dev, QA and PM to get our product area back on track including changing peoples roles so that their skills are maximized and adding additional headcount to fill open roles (who have the right skill set). I have also seen team re-shuffling (in order to increase cohesiveness) as well as managers on all teams being aligned in goals and counseling their teams to ensure we all work together as well as possible and are as successful as possible.Things are not perfect but our direct managers have made swift efforts to address things that are going wrong (with support of higher level managers). I have confidence that as issues crop up our managers in dev/qa/pm will be able to work together to make things right.Additional Pros:-Management (high level) has made significant investment in providing training to development teams on a multitude of things (product area, agile principles etc).-We are constantly being surveyed on various topics so that management can get a better idea of our needs.-Pay was so-so when I arrived but I guess management realized that they needed to pay better and I saw a generous adjustment to get me to a more competitive pay (and I didn't need to ask).-I really like my teammates. Even when we have disagreements we ultimately can find common ground because we truly want to do the right thing for workday and the customers. It is like our north star.-Managers got feedback from the folks working for them and I don't know the exact details but high scoring public managers were publicly recognized and folks seem to know who the low scoring managers are through word of mouth. This has put pressure on those managers who got poor marks to do better.-Promotions do not appear SUPER hard to get if your boss thinks you are a high performer. You might have to jump some hurdles or put in some time but its not like its not going to happen.-There seems to also be lateral mobility between qa/pm/dev (depending on skillset).-People are for the most part smiling/happy/nice/friendly which really brightens your mood.-Lots of employee-centric events. I participated to bring your parent to Workday and Bring your dog to Workday and they were a blast.-Lots of wellness offerings (new workout center, meditation classes etc)-People who are passionate.

There are managers who would be prefer to not have to manage people but who are forced to in order to move up the ranks, and there are managers who should not have been promoted to a lead role because of a lack of experience. Along with that, there is a reorg going on in the group, and lots of movement. Both contract employees and full time are being treated as if they are quite disposable and feeling very unappreciated and unnerved. Morale is at an all time low and the overall vibe is quite toxic. Even people who act as if they are content have their eye on the market. A lot of us that have been here awhile feel if it wasn't broke, why try to fix it?

Recently there have been complaints that culture was slipping because of hyper growth. What did leadership do? They flew every manager in the company and hosted a conference to help managers lead with their strengths and improve their weaknesses. For a company to spend time and money on something like this, truly shows their dedication to improve Workday. They really do focus on employees, the best they can.They do so many activities and contests to make things fun. I'm pretty sure every department is encouraged to hold quarterly events, whether it be the team going to a movie or helping out at a local food bank.Workday also is VERY big on service and gives you money towards your charity of choice as you spend your time. Every year Workday has \"cangineering\" which is a canned food drive. Every office has a chance to build a sculpture out of cans of food. Then the company votes on which one they like most (just a fun competition). After, all of the food donated is given to the local food bank. Workday even gives money to each office to spend of cans of food.Employees: Workday truly cares about your career growth. Now, I'm sure that may vary from department to department, but I feel generally it's true. They would like you to stay at one position for at least 18 months before transferring to another.Support Position: Even though you are expected to work certain times to support issues, management is flexible with your schedule and understands you have a life out of work. I feel it's a great work life balance. However you are currently required to work a \"late shift\" for a week, once a quarter. It's not the best, but they give you 2 comp days off and $500 bonus for doing it. You can also work from home during that time if you want. I think that's a pretty fair trade off.Benefits: I think the benefits are great! There are a few insurance options. For about $500 a month for a family, there isn't a deductible, $20 co-pays, $150 co-pay for hospital visits (Cost me $300 for a baby!), \"Free\" outpatient surgery.

This easy success has caused many of the management folks here at WD to get really arrogant and play extreme, petty politics. The fact that there are far too many middle-aged white women in management positions across the company, helps in increasing the degree of workplace politics.3) In an attempt to grow fast, WD let the guard down and opened the flood gates while hiring; and promoted people to management levels based on who they knew/their connections rather than abilities. This has caused WD to become a \"garbage recycle center\" for \"rejects\" from Cisco, Oracle, Amazon and ex-PeopleSoft (the old boys club of PeopleSoft!).4) CEO and top management are obessesed with company ratings on this website. Rumor is that, it is someone's full-time job within HR is to flag any negative reviews and get them removed.

These managers should have been fired but instead, they were offered other roles. If by any chance you set up a skip-meeting with the VP/SVP of your group, your immediate manager gets to know about it instantaneously! So much for their transparency and open door policy!

The company has been growing extremely fast which isn't necessarily a con, but in the case of Workday, I feel like it has been especially in how the culture of the company has been affected. Workday used to be a great place to work with very much a startup like vibe and the culture that also reflected what I felt was Workday's true culture. However, too many great employees that have been loyal to the company are beginning to leave or are looking to leave because they get passed up for promotions and instead end up with the responsibility of training new colleagues and managers who will make more than them for doing essentially the same work. You see this trend in multiple departments within the company. Most of the mid-upper management positions will be hired in from the outside and most of those managers will manage up and delegate menial tasks to their direct reports.The 'company culture' isn't really enforced and most of middle-management probably could not care less about it, at least that's how it feels now and I've been watching this trend for 1.5 years.I truly believe that executive management has employees bests interests at heart and talks about being transparent and gathering feedback often, but there hasn't been an environment that's been created where employees feel comfortable with speaking their minds because usually their managers are also in the room when these topics are mentioned. Aside from a few solid managers (true leaders as I like to call them) that truly care about their teams and work tirelessly to mentor, develop, and grow their members so that they succeed, it seems as though the rest are just concerned about themselves and making sure they look good for their managers so they can move onto the next best thing. Some managers are really nice and great people, but they don't fight for their employees when issues arise or when it comes to compensation and promotions, which is disappointing.There's a reason why employees are taking to Glassdoor to express their frustrations because there really isn't any other avenue aside from complaining to your co-workers (which happens often).

I am a bit newer and do not work in Pleasanton.Here's a frank review:The Workday infrastructure is incredible. They provide you with a tremendous amount of resources in order to succeed: mentorship programs, constant training, multiple weekly optional webinars to learn, a learning resource complete with courses, guides, and very detailed videos, an incredible amount of material from research reports to best practices, and a culture of helping. All my coworkers (or workmates as we like to call them) go above and beyond to help - the culture is really to try and remove ego and collaborate. Perhaps I got lucky with a good location and a good manager.There are many Oracle, SAP, and ADP transplants which may dilute the culture as some have complained, but as a newer employee, I think the culture is wonderful. The interview process is very collaborative to ensure that talented team players with a positive mentality become a part of the company. I initially interviewed with 5 people and had follow up mini interviews with 3 more.A competitive culture: this company wants to win. They celebrate wins and take a honest look at losses. The organization believes in its vision and I love how we stress 'Taking the High Road' and winning with integrity. There is a lot of mud slinging out there.The software is supported with attentive care and it shows in the product. Like any software, its not without its flaws including proprietary technology - but it works well. From what I can see, Workday is heavily invested in their clients' success, I feel this is a rarity amongst older software companies I've worked for.", "cons": "There are many smart people here - you will feel dumb or outclassed at times. Track to promotions can be difficult because of the talent.Workday seems to provide a modicum of autonomy across different geographic areas. Different geographies have different ideas on how to achieve goals while maintaining Workday's guidelines.Yes there does seem to be some cliquishness between the old guard and the newer folks - this is understandable because they've worked together so long, have become friends, and had to struggle when the company was much weaker competitively. Some older tenured employees do seem to be riding the gravy train at times. In this day and age, you can't just ride tenure. You have to back it up with performance. Your tenure may buy you a little respect initially but if you can't back it up, you'll lose it quickly and then some. Any interactions I've had with older guard have been neutral or positive. Forming meaningful relationships takes time but there is always an underlying level of respect. It is hard to get hired here, afterall.Workday has been scaling tremendously and with that comes growing pains and more layers of management. I believe this is necessary, however. It simply does not make sense to have 1 manager oversee 50 employees. The structure is broken down so that individual managers help 5-10 people and can give attention to their reports. Due to growth, some got promoted to managers while others didn't. Missing out on that promotion can be a source of frustration which is understandable. Again, tenure should not be the sole metric of promotion. Performance matters.Like any organization big or small, there's politics.

Being away from home double or triple the original expectation is not a small matter., but managers do not care.In addition, the software and approach was originally seen as nimble, light on low value documentation, and quick to react to customer needs.. Now the direction, as least from a services end, is to mimic the bigs, (more wasteful documentation, being onsite, billing and doing very little while onsite).

Perhaps the Workday that exists now is not as magical as it once was when it was a wee startup but honestly, this is still an amazing place to work. Perhaps it is because I came from an old school company but to me I see such amazing qualities in Workday. It has earned its spot in best places to work for sure! Why, you ask?-Management seeks feedback from employees. What? In other places I worked most management is closed-minded and entitled. At Workday the attitude starts at the top. What can you say bad about Dave/Aneel? My newbie coworkers and i attended our first Company meeting and we were so impressed. I am ridiculously impressed with Aneel's ability to give off an aura of authority but also warmth and humor. I would probably give up an organ to have that gift. I look around my floor and the folks who are in Director roles are the nicest and the ones who smile the most and will greet you and say hello. They are busy but they are kind and warm (in many cases). I am crazy about the kindness and humility of the leaders at Workday and the fact that they solicit feedback and value their employees. They truly get it! They are not just paying lip service.-There are many opportunities to get involved if you want it. There are a lot of groups and volunteer activities. There are fun events like mixers, Bring your dog to workday, team building. For folks who truly just wanna clock in and clock out go ahead. If you are looking for a social life at work they have that for you too.-Great product and inspiring vision. Its wonderful to work for a Company that is driven by building a great product, serving customers and making a profit rather than only making a profit. I have worked at too many Companies that are driven by the bottom line exclusively. It makes you feel dirty.-Mostly nice coworkers. With so many employees an occasional less than pleasant person will slip in but in general folks here are nice, passionate people with a good spirit. Even a developer who totally seems quiet/serious will send you a message saying that he enjoys working with you and appreciates your work. Even if the folks are not outwardly smiley happy super gregarious they are good people (or at least the vast majority).-People come and go as they please no one is monitoring other folks business hours. The most important thing is getting your work done and doing it well. You can roll in late or leave early but you will almost 100% sure have to log hours on weekends/nights at some point just due to deadlines for things and especially if you are taking vacay. So far I have taken two vacays and both times I had to work Saturday in order to get my work done and support my team. Working from home is very normal.-Unimited Vacay is not unlimited but you will be encouraged to take it. A coworker of mine was at Workday a couple months and had not scheduled any vacay and got called out. \"you need to book vacay\". Your boss will be checking up on you to make sure you are taking advantage of this policy.-Dog-Friendly! How much you can bring your dog just kind of depends on your dog and the people around you. This is not micro-managed just use your judgment. (at least if you work in a dog-friendly building which I do).-Snacks - for me this is a con. Perhaps you will gain the Workday 15? That being said I have heard rumors of GWs (gen workday) who are new college grads who fill up their backpacks with snacks (and presumably take them home?) Clearly someone is loving those snacks! They are almost always nearly cleaned out by the end of the day.-Proximity to Bart especially with the new building they are building.-Reverse commute from SF (although 580 is getting congested and not quite as great as it once was)", "cons": "Sadly, I have to agree with other reviewers that upward mobility seems almost impossible.

Multiple managers, per our Unlawful Harassment Policy, have stepped forward to report the issues. In return, they have been threatened, ostracized, and retaliated against. Meanwhile, the managers who participated in the harassment have been promoted, awarded, and received hefty increases in compensation.The standard tactics for the harassment and retaliation are below:Corrupt management gives a targeted employee an insurmountable workload, belittles the employee's efforts to achieve the impossible, then uses the \"lack of performance\" as a way to retaliate in the annual, or off cycle, calibration reviews. All of this is with the hope of forcing the employee to quit on their own accord. Any objection to this abuse of power is framed as insubordination and HR is called in to carryout their process for pushing the employee out of the company. In order to push the employee out of the company, management and HR work together to eliminate any internal transfers for the employee to other departments so they either have to endure the ongoing harassment, or quit.What is most concerning about this situation is that we are an HR software company that tracks ALL of this activity, and yet the behavior continues. Promotions, financial rewards, spot bonuses, etc. are not correlated with performance, but based on how well a person keeps their mouth shut. That either makes HR complicit with the behavior, or grossly negligent. Either way, it's not only illegal, but it is a clear violation of our Employee CodeOf Conduct and our Unlawful Harassment Policy, and you need to know about it.This company is one step away from a complaint with the EEOC, the DFEH, and/or the ACLU, and I am well aware of the statue of limitations in a harassment-discrimination case.

Needless to say, that gamble did not pay off...and to current employees of Workday, I hate to break it to you, but employers could care less what you did there.

I am only talking about my personal experience and not putting down anyone who has truly had an amazing experience here. This is a very political and clicky culture and people seem threatened by talent, and afraid to step on the wrong toes. Workday tries to give the appearance that they have this great culture but maybe what once were great ideals have warped into this superficial, passive aggressive one that promotes weak leadership, and a follower mentality. It would be a much more conducive to work in an environment where people are truly team players and want to do what's best for the company and the investors.When WD talks about being collaborative, they just mean shut your mouth and don\u2019t ruffle feathers. They say they promote innovation and thinking outside of the box, but that's all lip service. And I sometimes wonder if the people who are coming up with product ideas and functionality have ever even used similar products. There are very basic problems in the product but no one is willing to listen and use the resources that they have right underneath their noses.There are too many leaders, but none willing to truly lead. You have so many different \"leaders\" in one end to end process. Leaders don\u2019t get together to align their goals, resulting in very unscalable processes and frustrated employees; you can't report on useful metrics timely because the information input at point A isn\u2019t defined and agreed upon. The decision that wins often is not the one that makes the most sense. Ideas that benefit the company or are innovative are disregarded if the top people in power are against it. People are not held accountable for their actions. Leaders don\u2019t enforce any sort of discipline, which you need to have at any company in order to be successful. You have leaders who are incompetent yet they are let loose to run organizations the way they deem fit because they are friends with so and so, making things even harder to clean up as the company grows.There is no opportunity for promotion or growth. They hire leaders from outside of the org that have no clue as to how things are functioning specific to WD; and to top it off, the leaders from the outside seem pretty disengaged with their own departments when they get here.For a company who is all about HR, you\u2019d think relationships among their employees would be a primary concern. The leadership here seems more concerned with making alliances with other departments to further their own position, rather than taking care of the people working hard directly under them. I read a review here that talks about how toxic and abusive the leaders of the sales ops org are, and I can see that. You would have to be blind not to, but once again, it's about weak leadership turning the blind eye. I read a review that one person was shocked about the negative reviews in the sales ops org \u2013 again, this type of myopia instead of trying to understand why people are feeling this way is the exact problem.

How can anyone possibly be interested to work at a place if that is the top things employees can think of as its positive? But I too must digress since those are the few things to look forward to when you do come to work at Workday. Another thing is the reviews that does try to shed a positive light on Workday. It is apparently management's sad attempt to try and keep up the facade of Workday being a great place to work when it obviously isn't from all the top rated reviews. I do have to say one thing that is good and that is the GW program. Workday has managed to attract fresh college grads out of college and pay them at a minimum rate while being able to use their naive experience and make them believe that they are getting great work experience. To the GWs out there if there is one thing you can take out of the experience it is the grass is greener on the other side (life after Workday).", "cons": "So where do I start? Many of the top voted reviews have covered many of the cons already so I will just reiterate a few I feel require a second or third honorable mention. Middle management of MANY departments have people that have no business managing people. I have heard of one manager/director in support that has had close to ten people leave within the last year. When is the management above this person going to reevaluate why this is happening and do something to fix the attrition rate? Which is a good segway into my next topic. How can a HRM company have such a poor HR department? When it comes to being an advocate for the employee who is complaining about their management I have heard that the employee ends up being on the defense against the same management they are complaining about. What's the point in talking to HR when you know you will not be protected? Another topic I would like to touch on is using proprietary software language. As many reviews touched on this is a dead end for people that want to advance their career as a developer since I do not believe anyone has adopted Workday's programming language. Maybe one day it can be like Google's Big Data but I do not see it in the near future. The last is nepotism and how it runs rampant in Workday. There have been many times where people have been hired and or promoted cause they are management's favorites.

The meetings always run over the allotted time, disrupting the team's schedule. These meetings could easily be scrapped and the content emailed. No laptops are allowed at these meetings unless you are upper management (one person), so while waiting for the person to show up, the team can't work on anything else.

It's not unlike having a good football coaching staff but not enough talented players to win as much as we could and should be. Those that are on the field are often exhausted. The lack of support and resources doesn't go unnoticed by prospective customers and reps have to constantly deliver news that frustrates the customer - it is not uncommon to have to ask for a meeting to take place 3-4 weeks out because there simply aren't enough resources to support customer requests. Enterprise Sales in a highly-competitive market is always going to be high-stress/intensity, but far too much of the stress is created from lack of resources and from fighting for the resources we do have.

Alas, that was as short lived as my \"Career\" at Workday.", "cons": "There is palpable sense of falseness and fake frivolity that permeates the entire workday experience and work culture. Similarly, there is the same disingenuous tone to most of the positive reviews about workday, no doubt the product of some poor intern recruited by HR to game the review average with glowing accolades of the Workday Experience. Those young men hired right out of school (yes, Workday has the same extreme gender bias like the rest of Silicon Valley) and the interns seem to enjoy this culture of fakeness, perhaps because growing up they always got ribbons and trophies just for participating. Folks like myself, with 20+ years IT experience sense the falseness the moment we walk in the door and start coding.I liken the Workday culture to a cult. Cults typically prey on the young and naive and always have very rich, super controlling charismatic leaders and fiercely loyal lieutenants. And like any good cult, Workday doesn\u2019t want you to leave. I had 4 exit interviews prior to my departure. When I handed my letter of resignation to my boss, instead of taking it graciously and professionally, he instead handed it back to me and said \u201cOh, we can talk about that later\u201d. My immediate sense of that was, well you didn\u2019t value what I did while I worked for you, while should you value what I say when I quit!As most of the negative (and in my opinion) decidedly accurate reviews indicate, Workday doesn\u2019t pay that great. Their initial salary offer was a lateral increase in pay, justifying it with RSUs that vest over a 4 year period for as a yet unprofitable company. I held out for more salary (a 10% increase in salary), and much to my surprise they met my asking price. Unfortunately, it was all downhill after that.Overall, I felt my time at Workday was frustrating, confusing myriad of half-truths and promises made but never fulfilled, expectations set without timelines, time wasted and on an almost endless cycle of code re-working with out proper guidance, planning or direction. Oh and I did I mention that much of this wasted time occurred on my weekends or during the evening, that time, when according to all the positive reviewers written by that Intern from HR, I am balancing my life with work.The first sign that things were off to a bad start, was ironically my start date with Workday. I tried to push it back about 10 days (in order to get my semi-annual bonus from my previous employer), but the hiring manager was insistent and I stupidly agreed to it. A few months later, I was then hurried out equally quickly of the group I hired into and dumped into another group without prior consent.I strongly felt I was never given a chance to succeed or any kind of feedback on the work I did do. After approximately 2 months I did a performance review of myself that I wrote myself and never received any kind of feedback on that as well! I offered a co-worker approximately 30 documents (in addition to my daily coding tasks) I had written while trying to acclimate into the group. I even gave this same set of document to my Manager, only to have it summarily ignored.My genuine impression is that I was hired merely as a placeholder until the real candidate was available a few months later. The timing of my transfer to the other group I was put in left no question in my mind. This replacement candidate had previously worked with all the other members of my group (did some reviews say clique). The only other outsider within my group was accepted mostly because he seemed to fill the role of the team mascot and cheerleader. I was the true outsider in my group and for this, I was summarily banished because of it.Meetings were another cult like ritual at Workday. The first group I worked in met 3-4 times a week, and the 2nd group I worked in met daily for a 15 minute scrum that always went on for over an hour. All told, I would spend 10-15 hours a week in meetings and these meetings would spread throughout the day. It was genuinely difficult to establish a solid work rhythm when you\u2019re periodically interrupted to talk about the work you\u2019re trying to get done.A few months after I started at Workday, accrued vacation was rescinded. It was announced via an email, of course.There are of course, many more negatives \u2013 many of which were expressed in other honest (negative) reviews, such as the chronic back-stabbing, the lying, the Workday HR department that wouldn\u2019t know a hostile workplace environment if they themselves worked in one (and they do) and so forth.I genuinely think it\u2019s a good place for young people to work, especially those right out of college or interns. They can continue to earn their participation ribbons and trophies in the form of RSUs but for experienced IT folks (i.e. those of us who really know what we\u2019re doing), I think it\u2019s fake, it\u2019s a facade, a cult trying way too hard to be(profitable) .Software Company.", "date": "2014-12-27"}, "empReview_5608866": {"rating": "5.0", "pros": "Work/Life BalanceManagement Actually Cares About the Welfare of EmployeesTHE PEOPLE!!", "cons": "Fast Growth means that not all programs are rounded out yet.

We have:- 1-1 meetings every week and they're always very helpful.- team sync meetings to keep each other updated on progress (since we often work on distinct projects while collaboratinf with only 1 or 2 others in the team but not everyone) which are very useful.We are:- encouraged to propose change and innovative projects- given time to work on PoC the above ideas- collaborating with other teams to improve the internal security assets.Whenever there is a problem, we always do as much as we can to mitigate it rather than closing our eyes and ignoring it (as done in some other companies).Not only my own manager but also all the others in Security in Dublin are friendly, respectful, approachable, supportive of bottom-up ideas, of work-life balance and of advancing team member's knowledge and career.My job is extremely interesting and varied, since we balance between securing loads of different technologies and developing our own security tools plus often running internal pentesting.Even though it is hard to find senior sec people we have never lowered the standard in the hiring interviews.My manager also gives each of us clear goals for promotions: if met you're in, otherwise out -which is absolutely fair.Finally, I've never experienced any sexism at all - which is great nowadays. Indeed, our org and the whole company is full of inspiring women. We even have our own women@workday global group and local ones, which are all fairly active and full of useful initiatives.Not to mention:- perks, snacks, fruit (piles of berries, figs, mangos and avocados), benefits, bonus, stock- dentist/optician/massage on site- facilities to work and for entertainment (playstations, xbox, nintendo, table tennis, pool table, etc)- employees clubs well funded and supportive - help meeting other colleagues while exercising (many are sport-based) and having fun- giving&doing program - you get money based on the time you spent volunteering for a charity, which can only be used for further donations + your donations to a charity are doubled by the company every time- the nice people around you wherever you go: in the corridor, kitchen, etc. and all the nice people in the security team in Dublin.", "cons": "Since in my org the majority of managers are based in Pleasanton, US, there seems to be a bit of a disconnection between the teams over there and us.", "date": "2018-01-26"}, "empReview_18932082": {"rating": "5.0", "pros": "Nice people to work with", "cons": "No cons i can think of.", "date": "2018-01-26"}, "empReview_18659591": {"rating": "5.0", "pros": "Great company culture and continued focus on it", "cons": "career paths lacking for some divisions", "date": "2018-01-10"}, "empReview_18664218": {"rating": "5.0", "pros": "Innovative and fun companyRespect and fun are part of everyday at WorkdayInspiring management team and caring founders", "cons": "Cannot think of anything.

Application developers \"code\" in a proprietary language called XpressO. All the coding part is abstracted away and they only get to fill in some forms. If you develop in XpressO, you will eventually lose all your programming skills and in a few years become unemployable anywhere else (even though the company claims that XpressO helps you focus only on your problem solving skills without having to worry about the actual syntax, XpressO is not similar with any programming language).Not only the app developers have it hard. There is an entire team of people that builds a parser that takes XML and outputs JSON. The whole UI team's task is to create different components (text boxes, prompts, list details) which they rewrite almost every year in different technologies (Flex, HTML5 etc).Apart from the technical side in which you will basically end up doing the same thing over and over again (even though they proud themselves with being innovative), you have to know that the managers in Workday are not technical. Their only job is to supervise you, make sure you are doing your job. Probably it depends on the team and manager, but I had the misfortune to have a manager who micromanaged, who didn't want his team to work from home, who kept track of how much time we spent taking breaks (what's the point of having a pool table if you can't use it?!). Everytime there was a blocker, we had to go to him to explain the problem, go fix it and then go back to him to explain the fix. If you want a manager from whom you can learn, this is not the place for you.Workday mostly hires people straight out of college because they can pay them less and train them to have the expected mindset (\"yes\" people, that do what they are told). They don't want very technical people because technical people will leave in a very short time. Workday is the place in which you are evaluated by your attitude, and not your technical skills.People are intimated by their managers and are afraid to speak up.

This is not sustainable and is detrimental because of the following-1. Although we boast that we prefer to nurture internal talent, since last one year most of the managers have been hired from outside. This has not gone well with many of the star employees who have been with the company for at least more than a year and have worked day and night to make projects successful. No one works hard for free and good employees deserve to be promoted!2. Attrition has increased since last few months because of the professional dissatisfaction in employees. Another reason for attrition is most of the programmers in Workday work on a proprietary technology called Xpresso. Many feel that they get pigeon holed and won't find another job in Java or whatever background they came from. An Xpresso developer can work ONLY for Workday.3. The 'Workday' culture is fading away. Logical because most of the managers are being hired from outside who do not know what the Workday culture is and they try to implement their own ways to run their teams.4. The management has created an impression that it is one of the best places to work and the company is very employee centric. To be honest, most of the successful companies are so unnecessary bragging is meaningless! When someone joins Workday, his mind is sort of brainwashed that it is the best thing that could happen to his professional career :)This is just a gimmick and most of the guys start working crazy hours believing it. Not sure whose fault is this though :)5. If you are good in job A and you have proved your mettle in it, but you are more interested in doing job B, they will find a hundred reasons not to move you to job B. I have seen a case where an excellent resource has decided to quit his job because he was not moved to a different role he wanted to (he had prior relevant experience for that job) and instead someone with less relevant experience was hired from outside.

Speaking of growth, don't consider being promoted. They're so worried about upsetting anyone, they rarely promote from within the ranks with the exception of the few anointed who don't threaten the egos of the top dogs.

I personally think it's the most exciting place to work in Canada and love working here. Here's why:Meaningful work making an impact to users. The company has a clear goal and you're contributing significantly. You get to make improvements & provide value to the user's lives which is very rewarding.I've been encouraged to grow in terms of skills. I've learned Ruby on Rails, which I didn't know at all before. I've given a talk in front of a large group & wrote a blog post, neither of which I've ever done before and never imagined I would. This place can really encourage growth & improvement. Even though I'm a front end developer, there have been no issues with me doing some back end work or helping on other projects. It's all on GitHub and open to pull requests (feels like open source within the company).With thousands of smart & talented people in a culture where they can do amazing things & innovate, amazing products are created. The people here are very talented & helpful. Everyone supports & roots for each other. On Slack, we celebrate each other's accomplishments. Most of the people here could work anywhere. Many come from start ups in Toronto or moved from different parts of the world to work here.There are many opportunities to get to know others & work with them, for example Fancy Friday lunches once a month where you go to out to lunch with others (paid for by Shopify). Or a system that randomly matches you with others for lunch. Hack Days is another great chance to work with people you don't normally work with.Even though it's a big company, there is little bureaucracy. There is tons of internal communication where everyone shares what they're doing and everyone can ask any question and get an answer quickly. We're constantly doing things & telling people so that people are inspired & get feedback or help if needed.Compensation is high with public stock, something many other Canadian tech companies can't offer.Great offices, food is usually good, house-cleaning perk. Sometimes I come into work and there's someone cooking fresh eggs for you. Book bars where you can borrow some interesting books. Internal podcasts!Personally, I've never had to work evenings or weekends. Work from home & hours flexibility (can avoid rush hour on subway).Tooling is great: Github, Slack, with many integrations & reasonable processes. Because there are several cities, there are many cross-location meetings, but with google hangouts & livestream infrastructure it's painless.Really amazing employee conferences/events like Summit, opportunity to travel to other offices.Even though there's free beer/wine/drinks, it's not a very drink-heavy culture. There's no obligation to stay late for things like hack days, so I find it very inclusive for those in different life situations. People may have a beer or glass of wine during town-hall meetings, but I haven't seen it ever go too far.The employee population is diverse by gender, race, age & life situation, although it may skew younger than many larger corporations. Many women in leadership roles.As with other tech companies, love that we can wear anything to work (shorts, hoodies, t-shirts).You're always encouraged to give your honest opinion (in a respectful way), even if it challenges others.If you're a developer, how cool is it that the CEO wrote the original code for this big Rails app that tons of people run their businesses on?", "cons": "Growth rate is extremely high. After a few months, many on your team are newer than you. This is both exciting & has challenges. Each team or group can be different or have different processes, so my perspective might not be representative of all experiences working here. I've been here about 1 year and many are newer than me.There's a good on boarding process but I personally found Ruby on Rails to have a bit of a steep learning curve, coming from a JS background. Having said that, there is a lot of support and I've been able to learn it & contribute.There are 3 separate buildings in Toronto. The buildings are all nice but one of them is a bit of a walk away from the others, so you may not see people from there as often.With multiple cities (Ottawa, Toronto, Waterloo, Montreal, SF), groups can feel fractured, but travel, Slack & remote meetings can mitigate this.Those coming from more traditional companies might experience some culture shock by how casual & laid back it is here, but I think it's pretty standard for a tech & Silicon Valley style company. I've always worked in tech (in Canada) so things like sandals at work or beer at work is not shocking for me personally.There is a lot of autonomy & freedom which can be good for some, but an adjustment for others.

Fake-smiling supervisors and trainers who will turn on you at the drop of a hat.- 4-letter words -- that Glassdoor will not allow me to list here, including the big one (!) -- run rampant in company materials and verbal trainings: this is amateurish and repugnant to any professional business person. The use of this word would be a huge HR issue -- up to and including firing -- in the vast majority of companies if it was uttered, let alone published internally or used by trainers and other veteran employees in recorded training sessions, especially in a customer-facing department. But this occurs everywhere and all the time at Shopify. The Society for Human Resource Management reports that it it is disrespectful and \"can lead to depression, stress, reduced morale, absenteeism, retention problems [and] reduced productivity [and can] damage the image of the organization.\"- Poor training with recently-out-of-high-school former \"Guru\" trainers with all-powerful bad attitudes (and potty mouths) who throw systems, materials and jargon at you without any review of tools and resources: just a bunch of URLs to copy into your browser while glossing over material and requiring trainees to find highly-technical answers on their own via numerous badly-organized and difficult-to-search systems (compared to 1 or 2 with excellent search capabilities at leading companies). The little documentation that is provided in on-line exercises is often impossible to understand due to misinformation, misdirection and jargon. You're essentially thrown into a deep swimming pool without instruction on being taught how to swim. Then they will put you in the dog house and rationalize their bad management if you even hint that something could be done better or say that something was not explained clearly.- Non-divulgence of the actual expected work load during the interviewing process: 3 ongoing chats are needed (along with phone calls and emails), which is 50% higher than the norm in the industry (Amazon has a maximum of 2 chats, for example, which can be overwhelming at times... 3 is crazy and anti-productive, especially when you consider the highly technical subject matter usually involved). Pressure to upsell, even though sales was never part of the hiring conversation. At the mercy of many unhappy customers to award you (or likely not) an extremely high number of \"smilies\" or be punished for not achieving those metrics.- There are many reports on complaint sites of merchants enduring extremely long hold times and their accounts getting cancelled and/or payments delayed without any reason given (which the company says it can do in their Terms of Service), so the entire operation is extremely understaffed and badly managed. (It says that it will bar some sellers that may reflect badly on Shopify's reputation, so why does it still indignantly host Breitbart News, which promotes US ultra-right nationalism and has links to white supremacists, even after Shopify lost staff over the issue and continues to get lots of negative press about it?)- Your fellow trainees and workers will be mostly early 20-something former minimum-wage call centre and retail employees (which, I'm guessing, are the foundation for all the positive reviews here: they don't know any better compared to those of us over 35).- You have just one week following training to get up to snuff (according to the company metrics) or potentially be thrown out. This includes handling 3 chats on Day One.- It is essentially a company run by the Borg: you will enjoy being assimilated and won't ask any questions or you will be fired.- Do yourself a favour and read the negative reviews which are, by and large, accurate.", "date": "2018-03-22"}, "empReview_19391402": {"rating": "5.0", "pros": "Tons of opportunity for growth, great work life balance, really cares for the well being of their employees.", "cons": "Working rotating weekends but otherwise none.", "date": "2018-02-23"}, "empReview_18687826": {"rating": "3.0", "pros": "* Open minded folks.

At the end of your shift you can be held on a chat or call with a customer for an undetermined amount of time, which means you cannot plan a life for after your shift is over without expecting the possibility to be late. You're told basically that it sucks to be you if you get a call late. Your options are to a) suck it up and do your job, or b) rush the client to try and get them off the phone faster. If you do that though you risk the negative feedback that will affect your scores and employment. The system is SUPPOSED to be set up to not allow you to work more than 40 hours in a week according to terms in the employment contract. However, that's obviously not the case, as if you go over each individual day you can still access the system and are required to conduct work as per your normal scheduled hours. So basically they are just not willing to ever pay you for more than 40 hours a week. Even though you may be working significantly more. But through loophole because they pay more than minimum wage they are legally allowed to require this working off the clock. Honestly, it's bs and shows a lack of care and respect for the employee.2) Squad Leads are... to put it simply, less than trained. There is a need to promote the right people within the company and that is not happening. My current SL disappears for large amounts of time during the shift and is non-responsive when I need assistance. He uses nothing but buzz words to try and motivate the team without actually giving sound advice or mentorship.3) There are perks to working for the company, but they mostly feel like they are there to distract you from the fact that other things are not there. They feel like they're meant to placate you from a bigger picture of what you're not getting.4) Advancement opportunities seem bleak. You really can only transfer from one team to another based basically on what you want to choose to specialize in. Or god forbid you become a Squad Lead. Many people want to be \"mentors\" and get the chance to do the listening in to your calls and what have you, but they are doing it in an effort to not have to work themselves.4) The mentality is very hipster. Which is trendy sure, but leaves a lot to be desired. They've grown too big too fast and are not properly managing the people they have.5) New features are rolled out awkwardly and do not allow for older merchants who have been with the company to access new features that new clients can. Which creates an unnecessary strain on you as an agent to answer why.6) Goals are given daily, weekly etc. That are hard to maintain. You can and will be penalized for not reaching and meeting these goals. The frustrating part is when you're being \"coached\" by an SL who really doesn't seem to be meeting the standards of what it takes to be an SL himself.There are more cons, but I feel like.. honestly that's enough. I'm currently seeking other employment and would rather take a pay cut than to continue working with this company.It should be noted. I'm good at the job.

But inside, it was incredibly damaging for those of us who wanted to collaborate and solve for real problems beneath leaders who didn\u2019t know how or want to do either of those things.Despite high turnover, an inability to deliver basic features after spending years on them, re-building features on the same platform, and knowledge of bullying and harassment, the company has not made changes in leadership where it matters and instead has gone through its regular 1.5-year cadence of re-org and shifting to hide the damage (and protect those responsible because they have trouble hiring to replace them).There is zero accountability because the ability to safely give feedback about your boss no longer exists. Execs only seek input from directors, a few of which are sycophants and prone to gossip.In Product (product, ux research, design), many leaders are devoid of soft skills, don\u2019t foster growth, and don\u2019t understand employees\u2019 skill sets. Some seemed to have no qualifications for their position, whatsoever. Initially I empathized over the pressure they faced and their learning curve as the company scaled rapidly. But, true personalities came out with that pressure.At least three leaders hid insecurities by: not letting their teams make decisions, hiding their day-to-day activities or withholding information, preventing team discussion by pushing conversation into 1:1s, blaming their team for their own backfired decisions, creating false feedback as a punishment mechanism, and firing or running out those who challenged them.It is the luck of the draw if you join. There are a few good leaders who don\u2019t breed this toxicity. In my opinion, these leaders were still too passive to call out the damage being done by others.Problems exist beyond leadership. PM waste endless hours filing regression bugs (there is no real QA team). Simple changes are blocked by cross-team dysfunction. Finance often blocked delivery due to meaningless metrics. The Design org has struggled as subservient to Product leadership, who easily micro-manage design work because of the top-down approach and a lack of advocacy for design as an equal contributor. Positions for senior design leadership remain unfilled for years.

I was proud to be a part of the team and honored to work there. Then...post-merger...Grubhub began taking control...", "cons": "Nothing! It's a wonderful place to work and I love it!...yeah, because that sounds like something a human would write. If you're wondering why there are a bunch of 5-star reviews like that on this page, it's because HR began sending out emails telling employees to write 5-star reviews once the walkout happened....and by walkout, I mean, once everyone started aggressively quitting. Here's why:First of all, the CEO is an egomaniacal monster who has no value for his employees, whatsoever. Money is the bottom line, for himself. Once appointed as CEO over both Seamless and Grubhub, he began cutting benefits, eliminating staff parties, happy hours and lunches, and even cutting the employee budget when it came to ordering food on our own product. He also actively attempted to snuff out the Seamless brand entirely so that his \"baby\" brand, Grubhub, could \"win out\" in the end...as if was a schoolyard competition and not a beloved service and multi-million dollar business. The Seamless/New York team was devalued abundantly compared to the Chicago/Grubhub team, to the point where blatant favoritism caused inter-office tensions. And as they saying goes, \"poop\" falls from the top - so when he began replacing upper management, he hired people that fell in line with his beliefs.The environment shifted from a place of communication and collaboration to one of uneducated demands and unrealistic expectations. Do what I want regardless of whether or not it makes sense. Nobody was given the tools to do their job correctly, they were just told to do them faster. Any questions asked were met with threats and more demands. Budgets were slashed, employees were brutally fired for trying to help the company succeed and suggesting alternative solutions rather than \"falling in line\" behind blind leaders. Tyrannical leadership insisted on changing the entire beloved look and feel of the brand - stock plummeted, sales weakened, and consumer loyalty dropped off due to lack of rewards, acknowledgement, and cohesive brand messaging. Employees who had worked there for years and had a good understanding of the consumer-base were stripped of their power and responsibilities, and agencies were brought in to do the work of in-house teams. Money was spent irresponsibly and inefficiently.One by one, people began quitting (to the point where upper management began ordering those who gave notice not to tell other employees they were leaving in order to 'not affect morale'). And who was hired to replace these people? Usually nobody - work fell on those who stayed. Sometimes they would hire inexperienced, cheap replacements who they would refuse to train (or they just hadn't replaced the position that would normally train them...and never would), so eventually the company turned into the blind leading the blind surrounded by previously effective and enriched employees who were all trying to find new jobs.With each bad hire, upper management stubbornly holds up the facade that their candidate is successful in their post, praising them for the accomplishments of others (those who actually work hard, work smart, and execute any/all marketing materials are overlooked and insanely underappreciated) in attempts to create a false understanding that they made good hiring decisions as a means of saving face. It's perception over substance, every single time. In fact, Perception Over Substance should be the new, more accurate, internally representative company slogan...since they hired an agency to craft the nonsensical fluff line currently in use.I held on hoping things would go back to the \"old days\" for longer than I should have - then, eventually and intelligently, I jumped.

I have first hand information that they have the ability to create an app in which you are able to hear an offer even if you're talking on the phone.Another thing that may cause you to miss the opportunity to accept an offer is if there's a glitch in the app. That happened to me one time.

Our main job, (we've taken on so many it's hard to keep track sometimes) is to process new restaurant sign up contracts from Sales Reps. It's a lot of virtual paperwork, editing, data entry, and customer service as we have to be a liaison between multiple depts to get these new restaurants live on the site. We also have to communicate with restaurant owners about their menu, missing information that sales people forget to gather, and setting them live on the website. Keeping all that in mind - when sales reps get angry that things aren't being done fast enough or you're not allowing a contract to be completed because vital information is missing, you will take a lot of crap from people who you don't even work for. You will tell your boss about it, and nothing will come of it because he has no power over the sales dept, and HIS boss doesn't care about your concerns, and the cycle will continue. It's not an easy job to balance everything and put up with very strong personalities to begin with, not to mention...You will be severely underpaid and overworked. The low, non-competitive pay wouldn't be so bad if the people in charge of our dept hadn't consistently given our team more and more work without expanding the team or giving us any help. Since starting this job, responsibilities from other depts have not only been given to us but some teams have been flat out FIRED so the company can cut costs and we can take over their work. Specific example: There was a team of 5 based out of the New York office who were just let go in March so our team of 10 can take over their full time jobs in addition to the work we already do. On our team of 10 people, I believe we've lost about 7 over the last 6 months. The job has become a revolving door because of the low pay, excess work and demands, and zero appreciation or concern from the people in charge of the dept, most of whom happen to be callous and one in particular has literally referred to us as \"bodies\". As in, \"we have enough bodies to get the work done\", \"A body is a body is a body\", etc.I hope you're ready for none of your valid concerns to actually be dealt with. In response to complaints, our boss flat out told a handful of us several times that Sales Fulfillment is not a career, just a job. What kind of motivator is that? His boss knows he can just replace us with newer people who aren't at the end of their rope. At the same time, I can't really fault our boss because there's virtually no career advancement in all of our dept. He's right. There's no future here for anyone. The ONLY reason people are sticking around is the company used to give a decent amount of stock options upon employment. Those stocks are now worth some money, enough to make our total compensation actually somewhat baseline competitive, so people are sticking around to ride out their accrual. The big problem is that newer people, especially the people hired to replace all of us who've left, do not get that benefit and thus have quickly discovered that there is zero reason to stick around.If they want to solve their problems by just throwing fresh \"bodies\" at them, word will soon get out that this company clearly doesn't care about having a proud staff of loyal, hard working employees not to mention actually caring about them or valuing their opinions.

Again, it's a great place to work if your in the Chicago office or if you are a recent college grad. There is absolutely no opportunity for growth or advancement otherwise. Do not expect any sort of recognition for being a top performer. And expect to come out of pocket for the majority of your expenses spent in running appointments. Currently, some of your phone bill, some of your Internet, and some miles can be expensed. Also, we have experienced year after year of pay cuts and advertising has been stalled and so I don't know how well the company is doing as a whole . The most recent cut was about 40% of our commission and reps were given about 4 days notice. Also, don't expect to have any sort of input on your market. And don't expect any communication between yourself and upper management. Your territory or commission will change on a whim and you will have nobody to speak to.
